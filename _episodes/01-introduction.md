If you frequently work with code in your research, at some point you may reach a point when it becomes appropriate to share your code: Be it scripts for data analysis, code you have written for collecting and processing data, or some convience functions that you have invented for smoothing your own computing workflow. If you are writing a research paper, then there may be an imperative (e.g., from a journal) for you to share your replication package. Or, others could benefit from your own code as they may want to do similar things, such as retrieving data from a web API and transforming it into rectangular data tables. It is also possible that you are working on some advanced methods or techniques, for data analysis or modelling, and you want to share it with your research community.

For every piece of code shared, if you want it to be available to your audience, and its users discover and start to run it, it is not enough to merely put it online. Your code openly shared will not simply bump into your audience's sight. The access to your code needs to survive online search engines' retrieval or be seen by your potential users to reach their hands. Every time someone uses your code in their research, they should cite your code in a manner that their readers can find and access it. Only in this way can your code get distributed to its broad audience, and the credit to you (and perhaps your colleagues as well) could be properly given.

Unfortunately there is not automated tool for you to complete all this, so it is part of the code publisher's job to make the code visible and citable to its potential audience (just like you need to make your publication legible, with all polished figures and image captions, when you submit it to a journal's system). Then, ideally, your published code will be like any research publication, can be accessed, used, cited, and shared by others to more people, realizing its research impact.

> ## Think for a moment
> - Where do you share your code?
> - How do you want your users cite your code?
> - What do your users need to know in order to properly cite your code?
