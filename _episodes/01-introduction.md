If you frequently work with code in your research, at some point you may reach a point when it becomes appropriate to share your code: Be it a script for data analysis, code you have written for collecting and processing data, or some convience functions that you have invented for smoothing your own computing workflow. If you are writing a research paper, then there may be an imperative (e.g., from a journal) for you to share your replication package. Or, others could benefit from your own code as they may want to do similar things, such as retrieving data from a web API and transforming it into rectangular data tables. It is also possible that you are working on some advanced methods or techniques, for data analysis or modelling, and you want to share it with your research community.

One thing to keep in mind is, to give your code away somewhere online does not mean it could reach your audience. Neither can it ensure that you (and perhaps your colleagues as well) receive the due credit when it is reused by others. We would want our code product to be like journal publications, in the sense that it can be disseminated to its intended audience through well recognized channels; and it can be easily shared and referenced when others build on it for their own work. (Of course, you can imagine if the publication is open access, all this become far easier.) That means eventually the impact of your research work gets properly acknowledged. What is even trickier is that academic search engines and indexing databases (e.g., Google Scholar, CrossRef, Web of Science) capture publication records and even a tally of citations as a proxy of research impact. Can they capture the impact of your code?

Thus, this lesson intends to better prepare code authors to share their code in a manner that makes the code best available and enable crediting. Surprisingly, there exists a lot of frictions for someone to properly find and cite your code. It becomes part of the code authors' job to make this process easier. Fortunately, there are many efforts to improve the discoverability and citability of research code. All we need to catch up here is to master the means to maximize our chance.
